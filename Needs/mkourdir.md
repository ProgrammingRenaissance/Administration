# Make commonly used directories

 Make a Bash script to make a user specified  directory in the current directory and link this directory to a major directory. This allows instances of any type to be collected and allows the instances to be distributed.
 
 It should also be able to walk a directory tree and upgrade any copies of the specified directory that may be found to our current standards.
